# String Particle Protocol (SPP)

SPP is a minimal semantic space protocol designed for AI-native 3D world generation, optimization, and long-term evolution.

Instead of describing geometry directly, SPP represents space as a set of discrete cells with face-level connection options. 
The final 3D structure emerges through a collapse process that resolves these possibilities into a consistent spatial configuration.

SPP is designed to:

- Enable AI-driven world generation
- Separate spatial logic from visual representation
- Support long-term compatibility across devices and eras
- Serve as a universal semantic layer for games, simulations, and architectural spaces
